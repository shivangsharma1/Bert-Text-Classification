# Bert-Text-Classification
In this project I ahve done text classification(Binary Classification). The data set from Kaggle : Quora Insincere Questions Classification data.
This is my first transformers implementtaion project.
The dataset can be found on this link: [data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data).

The data can be simple downloaded from this [link](https://archive.org/download/fine-tune-bert-tensorflow-train.csv/train.csv.zip) but only train data, the data has a whooping size of 6gb.

Steps in this project:
- [Task 1]:  Introduction to the Project.
- [Task 2]:  Setup your TensorFlow and Colab Runtime
- [Task 3]:  Download and Import the Quora Insincere Questions Dataset
- [Task 4]:  Create tf.data.Datasets for Training and Evaluation
- [Task 5]:  Download a Pre-trained BERT Model from TensorFlow Hub
- [Task 6]:  Tokenize and Preprocess Text for BERT
- [Task 7]:  Wrap a Python Function into a TensorFlow op for Eager Execution
- [Task 8]:  Create a TensorFlow Input Pipeline with `tf.data`
- [Task 9]:  Add a Classification Head to the BERT `hub.KerasLayer`
- [Task 10]: Fine-Tune BERT for Text Classification
- [Task 11]: Evaluate the BERT Text Classification Model
